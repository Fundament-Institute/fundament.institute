<h4>Last Updated:  July 7, 2025</h4>

<p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") apply to your access to and use of the websites, applications and other online products and services (collectively, our “Platform”) provided by Fundament Research Institute (“we”). By accessing the Platform, you agree to these Terms.</p>

<p>Please refer to our <a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> for information about how we collect, use and disclose information about you.</p>

<h2>Limited License; Copyright and Trademark</h2>

<p>(a) Our Platform and the text, graphics, images, photographs, videos, illustrations, trademarks, trade names, service marks, logos, slogans and other content contained therein (collectively, the "Fundament Research Institute Content") are owned by or licensed to Fundament Research Institute and are protected under both United States and foreign laws. Except as explicitly stated in these Terms, Fundament Research Institute and our licensors reserve all rights in and to our Platform and the Fundament Research Institute Content.</p>

<p>(b) You are hereby granted a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to access and use our Platform and Fundament Research Institute Content for your own personal use; however, such license is subject to these Terms and does not include any right to (i) sell, resell or commercially use our Platform or Fundament Research Institute Content; (ii) copy, reproduce, distribute, publicly perform or publicly display Fundament Research Institute Content, except as expressly permitted by us or our licensors; (iii) modify the Fundament Research Institute Content, remove any proprietary rights notices or markings, or otherwise make any derivative uses of our Platform or Fundament Research Institute Content; (iv) use any data mining, robots or similar data gathering or extraction methods; and (v) use our Platform or Fundament Research Institute Content other than for their intended purposes. Any use of our Platform or Fundament Research Institute Content other than as specifically authorized herein, without our prior written permission, is strictly prohibited and will terminate the license granted herein.</p>

<h2>Open Source Software</h2>
<p>The source code for much of the software that supports our Platform is available for download as open source software. You agree to be bound by, and comply with, any license agreement that applies to this open source software. You will not indicate that you are associated with Fundament Research Institute in connection with any of your modifications or distributions of this open source software.</p>

<h2>Changes to the Terms of Service</h2>
<p>Fundament Research Institute may revise these Terms for its website at any time. If we make changes, we will post the amended Terms to our Platform and update the "Last Updated" date above. By using this web site you are agreeing to be bound by the then current version of these Terms. If you do not agree to the amended Terms, you must stop accessing and using our Platform.</p>

<h2>Termination or Suspension</h2>
<p>We reserve the right, without notice and in our sole discretion, to terminate or suspend your right to access or use our Platform. We are not responsible for any loss or harm related to your inability to access our Platform. You may stop using the Platform at any time. If we terminate or suspend your access to our Platform, any licenses or rights we grant under these Terms will be immediately revoked.</p>

<h2>Indemnification</h2>
<p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Fundament Research Institute, our subsidiaries and affiliates, and each of our respective officers, directors, agents, partners and employees (individually and collectively, the "Parties") from and against any loss, liability, claim, demand, damages, expenses or costs ("Claims") arising out of or related to (a) your access to or use of our Platform; (b) your User Content or Feedback; (c) your violation of these Terms; (d) your violation, misappropriation or infringement of any rights of another (including intellectual property rights or privacy rights); or (e) your conduct in connection with our Platform. You agree to promptly notify Fundament Research Institute of any third-party Claims, cooperate with the Parties in defending such Claims and pay all fees, costs and expenses associated with defending such Claims (including, but not limited to, attorney's' fees). You also agree that the Parties will have control of the defense or settlement of any third-party Claims. This indemnity is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other indemnities set forth in a written agreement between you and Fundament Research Institute or the other Parties.</p>

<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>Fundament Research Institute and the other Parties will not be liable to you under any theory of liability—whether based in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, warranty, or otherwise—for any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, punitive or special damages or lost profits, even if Fundament Research Institute or the other Parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages. </p>

<h2>Severability</h2>
<p>If any provision of these Terms shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions shall continue to be valid and enforceable, and shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of the Terms which will remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated to the extent permitted by applicable law.  If a court finds that any provision of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, but that by limiting such provision it would become valid and enforceable, then such provision shall be deemed to be written, construed, and enforced as so limited.</p>

<h2>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>These Terms and your access to and use of our Platform will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>These terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Fundament Research Institute, and there are no other promises or conditions in any other agreement whether oral or written. Both you and Fundament Research Institute hereto intends that these Terms shall not benefit or create any right or cause of action in or on behalf of any other person or entity other than you, Fundament Research Institute and the Parties hereto.</p>
